# Mysterious Crash with Third-Party Library in React Native

This repository demonstrates a difficult-to-debug issue in React Native involving a third-party library.  The bug manifests as an unexpected crash or incorrect behavior without clear error messages from React Native itself.  The solution involves careful examination of the library's configuration and potential conflicts with other dependencies. 

## Bug Description

When using the 'uncommon-library' package (a placeholder), the app crashes intermittently.  No helpful React Native error messages appear in the console.  The crash seems related to an asynchronous operation within the library.

## Solution

The issue was resolved by updating the 'uncommon-library' package to the latest version and verifying its integration with the rest of the project's dependencies.  Specifically, a dependency conflict was identified and resolved, preventing the async operation from causing the unexpected crash.
