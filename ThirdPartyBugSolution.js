The solution involves carefully reviewing the library's documentation, checking for updates, and resolving any dependency conflicts. Here's an example of identifying and resolving a conflict:

// Incorrect (Conflicting dependencies)
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "uncommon-library": "^1.0.0",
    "conflicting-package": "^2.0.0"
  }
}

// Correct (Updated and compatible)
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "uncommon-library": "^2.0.0",
    "react-native": "0.71.8" //Ensure React Native is compatible
  }
}

After correcting dependencies, run `yarn install` or `npm install`, followed by rebuilding and rerunning your project.
